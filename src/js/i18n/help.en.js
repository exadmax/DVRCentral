      <p>Config is where you adjust everything that used to be hidden in files: cameras, calendars, traffic, menu, the weather city, holidays and the integration accounts. It only works <b>when opened through the address of the home server</b> (the hub), because the hub is what stores the settings.</p>

The original configuration file still applies to everything you have not edited. To <b>take a section back to the original</b>, delete its key in <code>hub.settings.json</code> (or the whole file) and restart the hub. Keep a copy of <code>hub.settings.json</code> as a backup.</p>

      <p>Camera passwords, secret calendar addresses and API keys <b>never come back to the screen</b>: they show up masked (<code>*****</code>) or as “set”.

        <li>The user is usually <code>admin</code> and the password is the one set in the camera’s app (Mibo Smart). Getting the password wrong several times locks the camera for a few minutes.</li>

      <h3>Step 1: key and home</h3>
      <ul><li><b>Google Routes API key</b>: in the Google Cloud Console, create a project, enable the <b>Routes API</b>, enable billing (there is a free monthly quota) and generate a key. Paste it in the field; it stays only on the server. Blank keeps the current one.</li>
        <li>If you restricted the key by <b>IP address</b>, turn on “Use IPv4 only” in Integrations, because Google usually allows only the public IPv4.</li>
        <li><b>Home address</b>: the default origin of all routes. Write it in full, with number and city (e.g. <code>100 Example St, São Paulo, SP</code>). Without a key or a home address the panel shows <b>sample</b> data.</li></ul>
      <h3>Step 2: people</h3>

      <h3>When to query the routes API</h3>

        <tr><td><b>Automatic within a time window</b></td><td>The hub only queries inside the window (e.g. 06:00 to 08:00). Before it, the card says “Available at 06:00”. After the window it shows the last result, with no new query. Past <b>“Hide the card after”</b> (e.g. 09:00) the card shows “Mornings only”.</td><td>Fixed morning routine.</td></tr>

      <p>The interface (home screen, Fridge &amp; Pantry, Services, Cameras, Videos and Config itself, including this Help) is available in <b>four languages</b>: Português, English, Español and 中文 (Simplified Chinese).</p>
      <table class="help-t"><tr><th>Option</th><th>Effect</th></tr>
        <tr><td>Automatic</td><td>Follows the device’s browser language. If it is not one of the four, Portuguese is used.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Português, English, Español, 中文</td><td>Fixes the chosen language on this device.</td></tr></table>
      <ul><li>The choice applies <b>only to the device where you made it</b> (it is stored in its browser): the TV can stay in Portuguese and the phone in English. For the TV, open Config on the TV itself.</li>
        <li>The screen reloads when you change it. You can also force it in the address: <code>index.html?lang=en</code> (<code>pt</code>, <code>en</code>, <code>es</code>, <code>zh</code>); <code>?lang=auto</code> goes back to automatic.</li>
        <li><b>What is translated</b>: interface texts, dates and numbers (in the language’s format), the factory names of the menu (Games, Fridge, Cameras…), of the stock places (Fridge, Freezer, Pantry) and the national holidays.</li>
        <li><b>What is not translated</b>: whatever you registered yourself (camera, calendar, item, professional, renamed shortcut or local holiday names) and your Google Calendar events. Error messages sent by the server are translated when they are known; the others appear as the server wrote them (in Portuguese).</li>
        <li>The weather city, the time zone and the holidays come from your location, not from the language: changing the language does not change the city.</li></ul>` },

    { id: 'compat', title: 'Compatibility mode (TVs)', html: `
      <p>TV browsers (Samsung/Tizen, LG/webOS, Chromecast and similar) usually have <b>a single video decoder</b> and cannot show several live cameras at the same time. In compatibility mode the Cameras page shows <b>one camera at a time</b>, with buttons carrying their names to switch. The others stay disconnected.</p>
      <table class="help-t"><tr><th>Option</th><th>Effect</th></tr>
        <tr><td>Automatic</td><td>Turns on by itself when the browser looks like a TV. The text below says whether a TV was detected.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Always on</td><td>Forces one camera at a time (useful on a tablet or weak PC).</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Always off</td><td>All cameras at the same time, even on a TV.</td></tr></table>
      <ul><li>The choice applies <b>only to the device where you made it</b> (it is stored in its browser). For the TV, open Config on the TV itself.</li>
        <li>With a single camera registered, nothing changes.</li>
        <li>The home screen already shows one camera at a time in the rotation, so it is not affected.</li></ul>` },

        <tr><td>“No hub: open the panel using the address of the home server”</td><td>Open it through the server’s address (e.g. <code>http://192.168.0.10/config.html</code>), not through a file or another address.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Camera says “Connecting…” or “camera unavailable”</td><td>Are the IP/port/password correct? Is the camera on and on the network? Password with an unencoded special character? Wrong password several times (a few minutes’ lockout)? Test the same address in VLC.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>“The camera does not deliver H.264”</td><td>Use the substream (<code>subtype=1</code>). The main stream is usually H.265.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Picture disappears only on the TV</td><td>Turn on <b>Compatibility mode</b> (Compatibility tab).</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Camera thumbnails do not appear</td><td>They need <code>ffmpeg</code> installed on the server (<code>sudo apt install ffmpeg</code>).</td></tr>
        <tr><td>“could not read this calendar”</td><td>The iCal address is wrong, was reset in Google, or the server has no internet. Copy the secret address again.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Traffic shows “sample”</td><td>The API key or the home address is missing, or the hub could not reach Google.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Traffic with a “cached” tag</td><td>The last query failed and the panel shows the previous one. Check the key, Google quota/billing and the “IPv4 only” option.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>The traffic card says “Available at…” or “Mornings only”</td><td>It is the person’s window rule. Adjust the window, or switch to “Always”/“Only when I ask”.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>I changed an Integrations option and nothing changed</td><td>Those options only take effect after the hub restarts (yellow banner on the screen).</td></tr>
        <tr><td>I changed the Panel and the TV did not change</td><td>Wait up to 5 minutes or reload the TV screen.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>The screen opened in another language</td><td>In <b>Config → Language</b>, choose the device’s language. The default “Automatic” follows the browser.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Some error messages are still in Portuguese</td><td>They are server messages that are not translated yet. They only change language when they are in the panel’s known list.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>“origin not allowed to save”</td><td>You opened Config through an address different from the hub’s (e.g. a development port). Open it through the server’s address.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>“This hub is out of date and does not have these options”</td><td>The server is still running an old version of the hub. Deploy the new version.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>I cannot remove a stock place</td><td>There are still items in it. Move or delete the items and try again.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Upload to Drive fails</td><td>Run <code>rclone lsd REMOTE:</code> on the server; if it asks for a login, redo <code>rclone config</code>. See the error message in the “Google Drive” card.</td></tr></table>
      <h3>Back to the original</h3>
      <p>To undo everything done through Config, stop the hub, delete (or rename) <code>hub.settings.json</code> on the server and start it again: <code>hub.config.json</code> and the panel defaults apply again.</p>` }
